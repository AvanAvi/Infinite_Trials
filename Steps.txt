Trust the process fellas....(Avan baba says so..)

1. Read the partition number as a string from the user.

2. Initialize a dynamic programming table `dp` with `MAX_DIGITS + 1` elements. Set all elements to 0 initially.

3. Initialize the first element of `dp` to 1, representing the base case where there is only one way to partition the number 0.

4. Iterate over each digit position from 1 to `numDigits`, where `numDigits` is the length of the partition number.

5. Within each digit position, parallelize the computation using OpenMP to speed up the process. For each `i` from 1 to `numDigits`, iterate over `j` from `i` to `numDigits` in parallel.

6. Update the `dp[j]` element by adding the value of `dp[j - i]`. This represents the number of ways to partition the number `j` using integers up to `i`.

7. After all iterations, the last element of `dp` will hold the inverse of partitions for the given partition number.

8. Convert the resulting value to a string and print it as the inverse of partitions.
